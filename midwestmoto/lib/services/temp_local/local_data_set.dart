          ''' Indian Motorcycle redefined what an American V-Twin can be with the introduction of its category-defying FTR platform in 2019. Now, America’s First Motorcycle Company is taking the beloved FTR platform to a whole new level of street performance with the 2022 FTR lineup.
              Already admired for its unique styling, strong engine and great handling, the FTR is now at the top of its game when it comes to performance on the tarmac. With close attention paid to refining the engine tune, optimising suspension settings plus a steeper head angle, shorter trail and now running asphalt oriented 17” tyres and wheels; the 2022 FTR delivers world-class performance and agility while feeling more compact too.
              Heightening its street performance credentials, all FTR models now feature the sporty profile of Metzeler Sportec tyres and fully-adjustable suspension with the flagship FTR R Carbon benefitting from top quality Öhlins units front and rear. The new engine calibration takes advantage of the running gear enhancements by refining engine performance for a smoother, more predictable throttle response as well as cylinder deactivation to manage engine heat when the motorcycle is idle.
